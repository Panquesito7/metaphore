                <p><span className='text-4xl'>H</span>ello Punk! We are street programmer that work out of the box in everyway of traditional theory and we're not calling snippet of code but called as Metaphor.</p>

                <p>Programming languages are essentially bridges for communicating with people around the world without knowing their native language. We can collaborate with each other despite not sharing a common language.</p>

                <p>Our members are called Punks, Freestylers, and Software Freestyle Engineers, who create metaphors to make the world a better place.</p>

                <p>Every Punk can contribute their own unique style and unusual code snippets metaphor that challenge traditional theory or conventional business practics. But, it work! Thatâ€™s what being a Punk Freestyle Engineer is all about. Welcome to the Street Community Programmer.</p>
