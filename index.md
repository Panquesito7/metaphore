## Prologue
{: .text-center }

Hello Punk! We are street programmer that work out of the box in everyway of traditional theory and we're not calling snippet of code but called as Metaphor.
{: .text-center }

Basically programming language is a bridge to communicate with other people in the world without speak in their national language, we can collaborate each other without knowing our national language.
{: .text-center }

We called our member Punk/Freestyler/Software Freestyle Engineer that create some Metaphor to make this world more better.
{: .text-center }

Every Punk can make any contributions to share your styles and unsual ~~code snippet~~ metaphor that belived it's something wrong different in traditional theory or usual business, but it's work! That our Punk Freestyle Engineer. Welcome to the Street Community Programmer.
