# OUR SOLID CODE OF CONDUCT

Yo, welcome to the Street Community Programmer! We believe in creating an inclusive and respectful community where everyone feels comfortable and heard. To make sure we're all on the same page, we have a few guidelines we ask everyone to follow. Check it out:

# The Code
1. Respect each other.
2. Keep it clean.
3. Be yourself.
4. Stay open-minded.

## The Consequences
If you violate any of these guidelines, we may take action, including but not limited to:
- Removing your contributions from the community
- Blocking you from the community
- Not inviting you to our next party (just kidding, we'll still invite you)

## The Callout
If you witness someone violating the code of conduct, please let us know. You can reach out to any of our moderators or shoot us an email at [missing-email](meh).
