    <h2>How it's work?</h2>
    <p>⍿ We use <strong>GitHub issues</strong> templates to create a new <code>metaphore</code>.</p>
    <p>⍿ Once the <code>metaphore</code> is accepted, we use <strong>GitHub Action</strong> to generate a markdown file that contains the <code>metaphore</code>.</p>
    <p>⍿ The website vercel build is triggered and updated automatically.</p>
    <p>⍿ Your <code>metaphore</code> is now live online!</p>

    <h2>Metaphor Story - Structure</h2>
    <p>Our Metaphor Story has several components that aim to provide context and explanation for the submitted metaphor.</p>
    <h3>Story Title (Required)</h3>
    <p>The first component is the Story Title, which is a concise and descriptive title that summarizes the main idea or concept behind the metaphor. This component is required, as it helps readers quickly understand what the metaphor is about.</p>
    <h3>The Back Story about your Metaphor (Required)</h3>
    <p>The second component is the Back Story about your Metaphor, which is a brief explanation of the inspiration or motivation behind the metaphor. This component is also required, as it helps readers understand the context in which the metaphor was created and why it might be relevant or useful.</p>
    <h3>The Story (Required)</h3>
    <p>The third component is the Story itself, which is a detailed description of the metaphor and how it works. This component is also required and should be written in a clear and easy-to-understand manner, so that readers can follow along and potentially use the metaphor in their own projects.</p>
    <h3>Demo/Link (Optional but recommended)</h3>
    <p>The fourth component is the Demo/Link, which is an optional component that can be used to provide additional information or examples of the metaphor in action. This could be a link to a live demo, a GitHub repository, or any other relevant resource.</p>
    <h3>Donation Link (Optional)</h3>
    <p>The fifth component is the Donation Link, which is also optional and can be used to provide a way for readers to support the creator of the metaphor. This could be a link to a Patreon page, a PayPal account, or any other relevant donation platform.</p>
    <p>Overall, the structure of Our Metaphor Story is designed to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-understand format for sharing unconventional <s>coding solutions or</s> freestyle metaphors that could be useful for other freestylers.</p>
